- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Export components using arrow functions: `export const ComponentName = (props: Props) => {}`
- Avoid using `React.FC` or `React.FunctionComponent` type annotations
- Import React only when explicitly needed (React 17+ doesn't require it for JSX)
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use PascalCase for component names and component files
- Use descriptive component names that indicate the component's purpose
- Avoid abbreviations in component names
- Use camelCase for prop names
- Boolean props should be prefixed with `is`, `has`, `can`, or `should`
- Use optional props sparingly and provide defaults when needed
- Keep props interface small and focused
- Co-locate props types with their components (same file)
- Export props types when they need to be used by other components or tests
- Don't store derived data in state
- Name custom hooks with `use` prefix
- Keep useEffect effects focused and specific
- Use `React.memo` for components that receive the same props frequently
- Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Use `useCallback` for functions passed to child components
- Avoid props drilling where props are only passed down to child components
- Do not mutate props or state. Create a copy array or object if possible
- Avoid using index as the key prop value
- Avoid using inline functions in jsx or tsx blocks for event handlers and callbacks passed to child components. Use `useCallback` instead
- Inline functions in map/filter callbacks are acceptable: `items.map((item) => <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>)`
- When possible use ternary operators for conditional display. Use this pattern `{shouldShow? <MyComponent />:null}` instead of `{shouldShow && <MyComponent />}`
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks when needed
- Use Redux hooks (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) instead of connect HOC
- Use `react-query` for server state management
- Avoid using custom CSS. Always use PatternFly components, variables, and utility classes
- File organization: Component.tsx, Component.spec.tsx, Component.stories.tsx
