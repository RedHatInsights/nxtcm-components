- Add JSDoc comments to exported components, types, and complex functions
- JSDoc should include a brief description and @param tags for parameters
- Use inline comments to explain complex logic or business rules
- Comments should explain "why", not "what" (code shows what)
- Keep comments concise and up-to-date with code changes
- Use lowercase for inline comments (e.g., "calculate totals" not "Calculate Totals")
- Add JSDoc to exported types with descriptions of each property when the purpose isn't obvious
