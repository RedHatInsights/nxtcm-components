- Define prop types using TypeScript `type` or `interface` (both are acceptable)
- Use `type` for component props that use unions or intersections
- Use `interface` for props that may be extended
- Define props interfaces/types in the same file as the component
- Define interfaces for all props and complex objects in tsx and ts files
- Use union types for known variations in tsx and ts files
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` if needed
- Use existing types saved in `src/types` child directories if possible
- Use proper TypeScript error types instead of generic Error objects
- Use `Partial<T>` for optional object properties instead of making each property optional
- Use `Record<string, T>` for object maps instead of `{ [key: string]: T }`
- Define return types for all functions and methods
- Import types with `import type` syntax to avoid runtime imports
- For index.ts files, prefer named exports over wildcard exports: `export { Component } from './Component'`
